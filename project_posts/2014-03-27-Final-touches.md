After careful code analysis I fixed errors which may lead to the application crashes. Also, slightly increased the size of the font used when generating the artwork. By the way, it would be nice to add this parameter to the app's preferences in the future.

At the current stage the application is ready to show to end users, so I prepared and published it to the Gogle Play. The link to the application have been added to the project description.

The next step could be to add an animation when changing images, possibly several different types. However, time does not remain so I publish the project as it is.
